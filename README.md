# Matchmaking Service
A conceptual model of an online service for matching players in competitive games.
Built with the purpose of exploring an intersection of two passions: video games & backend systems. 

Without overloading on complexity, I've decided to build this project with the following constraints:
- Mocking of player / client requests using python scripts
- API without AUTH
- Simple in-memory models for tracking game state
- Simulated matches

## Development
### Setting up & using a python environment
For first time use, set up a python environment using:
`python3 -m venv .venv`

Afterwards, use the following to activate the environment when working on the project:
`source .venv/bin/activate`

<br>

### Building & running
For building the project into a runnable program use:
`pip install -e ".[dev]"`

To spin up the server, use run.py in `scripts/`:
`python scripts/run.py`

## Core Dependencies
This project utilises the following dependencies:
- fastapi for the web backend framework
- uvicorn for running the application server
- setuptools as the backend build system
